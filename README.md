# extract-specific-text-from-image

Using this script 'img_to_text.ipynb' -

You can extract emails from a screenshot. You can also extract other text based on your requirements and conditions.

Required libraries:

1. Pandas
2. Opencv
3. easyocr
4. os

I have added comments for every step in the script.

Thankyou.
